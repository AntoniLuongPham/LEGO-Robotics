# AA Robotics Team Session 2


## Monday 2021-09-06

Skip the standard WeDo lesson as team members are already familiar with WeDo.

Instead of designing and prototyping 2 new forms of transportation, decide to focus on improving (by motorizing) the existing cargo truck designed and built in Session 1.

Go through the Engineering Design Process:

- __Explore__: design enhancements to motorize the cargo truck, with the WeDo Hub controlling the Motor which is in turn connected to the Wheels through a rubber band

- __Create__: build the motorizing components for the cargo truck, and code the program to make the truck go forward

- __Test__: make the truck go forward by running the program
  - _realize that the rubber band is not long enough to connect the motor to the further wheels_
  - _decide to improve the design by connecting the motor to the nearer wheels instead_
  - _test again_

- __Share__: `TODO`

Core values covered in this session:
- Teamwork

`TODO`:
- take photos and videos of motorized cargo truck
