Everyone on the team could experience each role multiple times throughout their FIRST® LEGO® League Explore experience. Using roles helps the team function more efficiently and ensures that everyone on the team is engaged. Some roles will be filled by multiple children during a session. For example, the builder and coder roles can be duplicated where the experience is designed for a pair of children.
