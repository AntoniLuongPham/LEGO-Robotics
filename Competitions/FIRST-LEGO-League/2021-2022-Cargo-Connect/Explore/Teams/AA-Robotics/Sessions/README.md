## Sunday 2021-09-05

Assign roles:
- __Facilitator__: Daddy @TheVinhLuong102;
- __Journey Recorder__: Daddy @TheVinhLuong102;
- __Team Captain__: @AntoniLuongPham;
- __LEGO Element Finder__: @AntoniLuongPham;
- __Material Manager__: @ArianaLuongPham;
- __Builder__: @ArianaLuongPham;
- __Coder__: @ArianaLuongPham.
The assigned roles are recorded on a sheet taped to the Team Meeting Guide.

Learn FIRST core values:
- Write and/or draw about the 6 core values; and
- Quiz each other about the 6 core values by one person hiding the text and asking the other person to guess the core value that the writing or drawing refers to.

Prepare team materials:
- WeDo set;
- Cargo Connect set; and
- Macbook laptop.
Team members are very familiar with LEGO and already quite disciplined about managing our LEGO inventory.

Plan timeline:
- Cycle quickly through Sessions #1-7, which are about basic knowledge and practice; and then
- Spend a lot more time on Sessions #8 onwards, which are about building, documenting and presenting the team model.

Distribute and label the Engineering Notebooks.

Work on [Session 1](Session-01).
