## Getting Started


### 1. Introduction


#### 1.1. Welcome to Explore


__Introduction to FIRST® LEGO® League Explore__

In FIRST® LEGO® League Explore, teams focus on the fundamentals of engineering as they explore real world problems, learn to design and code, and create unique solutions made with LEGO bricks and powered by LEGO Education WeDo 2.0. FIRST LEGO League Explore is one of three divisions by age group of the FIRST LEGO League program. This program inspires young people to experiment and grow their confidence, critical thinking, and design skills through hands-on STEM learning. FIRST LEGO League was created through an alliance between FIRST® and LEGO® Education.


__Before Starting__

Allow several weeks from the time of purchase until all the product ordered arrives and has been distributed and set up (software downloaded onto electronic devices, devices connected to the internet) before officially starting the program. 

The actual season will open in August, and that is when the Explore set and guidebooks will ship to you. You will find the season materials [here](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/season).


__Working Together__

During each session, the children will experience the engineering design process. There is no set order for this process, and they may go through each part several times in a single session. This means that children will be exploring the theme and ideas during a session, creating solutions, testing them, iterating and changing them, and then sharing what they’ve learned with others.

Children work together in teams of six using pieces from the LEGO® Education WeDo 2.0 set and an Explore set. They will collaborate and communicate to build, learn, and play together. Children should be encouraged in every session to work with their teammates, listen to each other, take turns, and share ideas and pieces.

- Coding team model
- Showcasing at festival
- Building team model
- Working as a team

#### 1.2. Getting Started Checklist

__Getting Started Checklist__

Use this checkpoint to help you get started and guide you toward success. Many of these items are explored within the other sections of this course. 

- Ensure you have received all materials needed to implement FIRST® LEGO® League Explore.

- Read the student Engineering Notebook and the Team Meeting Guide before starting the sessions. They are full of very useful information to guide you through the sessions.

- Identify the space where you will complete the sessions and store materials between the sessions. Or a place to keep assembled builds between sessions if desired.

- Think about the final celebration event. Will you have it in your classroom and invite the children’s families? Or will you have your registered team attend a festival led by your local partner?

- Create a plan. How often during the week will you do it? Will you complete a whole session at once or split the tasks across different times?

- Unpack the WeDo 2.0 set (if not already done) and sort the LEGO® elements into the tray before starting Session 1. 

- Get your children familiar with WeDo 2.0. The children could complete the Introduction and some Getting Started activities in the app so that they gain experience in building and coding before starting the sessions.

- Make sure you have a Bluetooth-enabled device with the WeDo 2.0 app installed.

- Make sure the hub is fully charged or has batteries in it.

- Encourage family and home engagement. 

- Familiarize yourself with the contents of the Explore set.

- Explore the FIRST® Core Values. These are the essential foundation for your team.

- Watch the FIRST LEGO League Explore Season video and other videos on the [FIRST LEGO League YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGaG4GtEj82i3pByi_bM3A).

- Discuss vocabulary related to the season theme with the children.



#### 1.3. Explore Materials

Look over the following list for what materials and space you will need in your classroom or meeting space. It is recommended that students work in teams of four if implementing in a classroom. Each team will need space to design, build, and code with their WeDo 2.0 set as well as to participate in teamwork activities. Access to an electronic device is important for each team to have for a successful program implementation. 

For each student:
- 1 Engineering Notebook

For each team:
- LEGO Education WeDo2.0 Set
- 1 Explore Set
- 1 electronic device (see Team Meeting Guide for specific details)
- Team poster board and art supplies

Classroom or Meeting Space:
- Small workstations/tables for each team (enough space for LEGO building, electronic device, and assembled models)
- Portable or permanent storage
- Internet access (optional)
- Electrical support

Inventory:
- Explore Set
- Prototyping Pieces
- Explore Model
- Explore Mat
- Building Instructions
- Engineering Notebook
- Team Meeting Guide
- Class Pack Event Guide
- Class Pack Implementation Guide
